## ATLAS-OVERLAY-GEN-STALE-1 — Cross-repo path deps on member mainlines [arch] — todo (needs user decision)

- Owner: unclaimed; scope: `.cargo/config.toml`, `scripts/atlas-stack-overlay.py`,
  and the member manifests listed below. **Held for a user decision** — see the
  conflict at the end.
- **My 2026-08-03 diagnosis on this item was wrong and is corrected here.** I
  filed it as "the generator is stale against the package renames". It is not.
  Run twice in a row the generator is byte-identical (`cmp` clean), and it emits
  the same 38-line reduction against the committed overlay each time. It is
  idempotent and its output is *correct*.
- The real cause: the generator derives the overlay from the **git**-dependency
  closure, and six members no longer declare git dependencies — they were
  migrated to cross-repo path dependencies. So the generator rightly stops
  emitting patches for them, and the committed overlay is what is stale,
  carrying dead entries (`apollo-nufft`, `apollo-sht`, `asclepius-coeus`,
  `athena-leto`, and an entire `[patch."…/coeus"]` section).
- Measured 2026-08-03, path deps that **escape their own repo** (intra-workspace
  **(CORRECTED below — this measured worktrees, not committed state.)**
  `../sibling` paths excluded by resolving each path against its repo root):
  athena 36, and 25 in a private consumer — those two are the only ones
  actually committed. The kwavers/helios/ritk/CFDrs counts in the original
  measurement were uncommitted worktree edits and are withdrawn.
- **Correction 2026-08-03.** My original figure of 163 across six members read
  working trees. Committed state across the whole stack is: **athena 36** (the
  sole tracked member carrying committed cross-repo path deps, and red on CI
  for exactly that), plus 25 in the untracked private consumer. Every other
  member's committed manifests are clean `git + version`.
- That shrinks the decision considerably: it is about athena, not about a
  stack-wide cutover. athena's `[patch]` at `Cargo.toml:119-120` plus its
  path deps are what keep its CI red.
- Method note for anyone re-measuring — this is the second time I generalized
  from worktree state (the first was the lockfile survey under
  ATLAS-PUB-LOCK-1). Under the overlay, working trees routinely diverge from
  HEAD. Always read `git show HEAD:<path>`, and for anything about how a
  consumer or runner sees the repo, clone it in isolation:
  `git clone --depth 1 file:///D:/atlas/repos/<name> /d/tmp/isolated/<name>`.
  athena 36, kwavers 31, helios 29, ritk 22, CFDrs 20, plus 25 in a private
  downstream consumer —
  **163 total**. Example: `repos/kwavers/Cargo.toml` → `../../repos/aequitas`.
- These landed deliberately in `b2ee610` ("Migrate kwavers/cfdrs/helios/ritk to
  local path deps", authored by a non-Claude agent). Two notes on that commit:
  its body claims the migration covers manifests whose recorded gitlinks do not
  in fact contain it, and it states plainly that it landed with builds still
  failing ("remaining build failures are pre-existing code errors").
- **The conflict, which is why this is not being fixed unilaterally.** Standing
  stack policy is that member manifests keep `git + version` sources and the
  root `[patch]` overlay owns local resolution — a member carrying path deps is
  unconsumable as a git dependency, and the two mechanisms now contradict each
  other. The mechanical fix is to convert all 163 back and regenerate. But that
  is a 6-repo revert of another agent's deliberate, stated intent, and three of
  those repos currently have live peer branches (`coeus` mid-publish-cycle,
  `CFDrs` on a codex branch, `ritk` on a feature branch). Reverting a peer's
  intentional migration at that blast radius is a call for the user, not for an
  autonomous tick.
- Whichever way it goes, one of the two mechanisms should be retired rather than
  left in contradiction: either the path deps convert back and the overlay stays
  authoritative, or the overlay is deliberately narrowed and the generator's
  freshness check updated so `generate` stops looking like a regression.
- **Concrete consequence found 2026-08-03: this breaks CI, not just theory.**
  `athena` has been red for five days with
  `failed to load source for dependency themis` / `unable to update
  /github/themis`. Its manifest carries a committed
  `[patch."https://github.com/ryancinsight/themis"] themis = { path = "../themis" }`
  (`athena/Cargo.toml:119-120`). That resolves inside the Atlas tree and cannot
  resolve on a runner that checks out one repo — which is exactly the property
  that makes a member unconsumable as a git dependency.
- So the cost of leaving this unresolved is now measurable: at least one member
  is permanently red, and any repo that gains cross-repo path deps joins it.
  athena is deliberately **not** fixed here — removing that `[patch]` is the
  decision this item is waiting on, and athena additionally needs the
  ATLAS-PUB-LOCK-1 lock repair, so its CI will not go green from either fix
  alone.
- Note for whoever measures this again: a naive `grep 'path = "\.\./'` is
  useless here — it counts ordinary intra-workspace sibling paths and reported
  473. Resolve each path against its repo root and keep only the escapes.
