## ATLAS-PUBLISH-001-BOOK-MDBOOK-TEST-001 — Cross-book `mdbook test` gate alignment [patch] — blocked

Coordinator-owned evidence record (this entry) under
eer-coordinated execution: kwavers peer on branch
`codex/kwavers-book-migration-eviction` (peer mid-flight on
`ATLAS-BOOK-002` eviction). CFDrs peer on `main` branch, 1 ahead of
`origin/main f04b1d75` (autest sub-task, see
`ATLAS-CFDRS-COEQ-BLOCKER-1`). Helios peer on
`origin/main 433ddb6`. Each member-repo peer owns their own workflow
`book-pages.yml`; coordinator cannot edit those files per
`concurrent_agents` disjoint-scope primitive — this entry surfaces the
shared gap and per-repo sub-scopes so each peer claims the disjoint slice
against their own repo. Coordinator verification of the shared gap was
performed against each repo's `origin/main` HEAD.

- Policy: AGENTS.md engineering_gates "Publish pipelines" — book
  workflows run build + `mdbook test` → `upload-pages-artifact` →
  `deploy-pages` (the test gate is the test-suite coverage for
  documentation samples, preventing rotted non-compiling example code
  from deploying).
- Discovery evidence (verified at Session 18 via `git show
  origin/main:.github/workflows/book-pages.yml` on each repo):
  - **kwavers** (`origin/main c19134ec`): steps `Configure Pages`,
    `Install mdBook`, `Build book` (runs `mdbook build docs/book`
    only), `Upload Pages artifact`, `Deploy to GitHub Pages`. No
    `mdbook test` step.
  - **CFDrs** (`origin/main f04b1d75`): identical step shape
    (`Configure Pages` → `Install mdBook` → `Build book` running
    `mdbook build` only → `Upload Pages artifact` → `Deploy to GitHub
    Pages`). No `mdbook test` step.
  - **helios** (`origin/main 433ddb6`): identical step shape. No
    `mdbook test` step. (Cited as residual (a) in
    `ATLAS-HELIOS-BOOK-001` Session 18 closure.)
  - All three deploy via `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4` →
    `actions/deploy-pages@v4` with `pages: write` + `id-token: write`
    on the `deploy` job and deploy gated on
    `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` (main-only). The artifact
    flow is already compliant; only the `mdbook test` step is missing.
- Outcome: each per-repo peer-coordinated sub-slice lands one PR
  inserting a `Build book`→`Test book samples` step (running
  `mdbook test docs/book`) between `Install mdBook` and
  `Upload Pages artifact`, fail-closed on doctest failure. The (1)/(2)
  crates.io/PyPI scopes of `ATLAS-PUBLISH-001` remain separate and
  unowned — this sub-slice addresses only the (3) Books test-gate
  gap. Per-repo sub-scope (peer-coordinated):
  (a) **repos/kwavers/.github/workflows/book-pages.yml** — peer-kwavers
      holds active eviction branch (`codex/kwavers-book-migration-eviction`,
      1 ahead of `origin/main c19134ec`); the `mdbook test` step landing
      is complementary to eviction (examples must compile for `mdbook
      test` to pass, and eviction is removing the migration-reference
      examples that are least doctest-fit), so sequencing eviction first
      is the cleanest order. Awaiting peer eviction merge to `origin/main`.
  (b) **repos/CFDrs/.github/workflows/book-pages.yml** — peer-CFDrs
      on `main` ahead 1 of `origin/main f04b1d75`; lands after the
      `ATLAS-CFDRS-COEQ-BLOCKER-1` workspace-restore + check-figures
      re-verification so the local `mdbook test` pre-flight is backed by
      a fully-resolved Cargo graph (the coeus-core path-dependency
      gap currently stops local cargo metadata resolution).
  (c) **repos/helios/.github/workflows/book-pages.yml** — peer-helios
      at `origin/main 433ddb6`, book content ready to test. No known
      pre-requisite for the `mdbook test` step landing; cleanest
      per-repo increment of the three.
- Acceptance: each `book-pages.yml` carries a `mdbook test docs/book`
  step running doctests on committed sample code; book deploy still
  artifact-based with the test gate; user-action list (registry
  enforcement toggles) recorded on the board remains the same.
- Risk/change class: `[patch]` CI-only; no production-code delta.
- Dependencies: ATLAS-PUBLISH-001 (parent),
  ATLAS-BOOK-002 (kwavers eviction sub-scope ordering);
  ATLAS-CFDRS-COEQ-BLOCKER-1 (CFDrs cargo-graph restore).
- Evidence limit: workflow-step inspection on each `origin/main`;
  no performance claim, no production-code delta.
- Refs: backlog.md#ATLAS-PUBLISH-001 (parent slice),
  backlog.md#ATLAS-BOOK-002 (kwavers peer eviction),
  backlog.md#ATLAS-HELIOS-BOOK-001 (Session 18 closure residual (a)),
