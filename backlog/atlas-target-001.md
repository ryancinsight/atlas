## ATLAS-TARGET-001 — One build cache, one debug budget [patch] — in-progress (residual)

- Owner: Codex `/root`; last-update: 2026-07-22; scope: cache trees and
  profile sections only, no simulation logic.
- Done 2026-07-21: 18 stale cache forks deleted (repo-local `target/`, `target_isolated`, `target_benches`, nested crate `target/`) reclaiming 177.8 GB; `moirai` dev/test profiles aligned to line-tables-only/deps-none (was `debug = true`, pushed `946b4a7`); root `.cargo/config.toml` gains `[profile.dev.build-override] debug = false`. Policy: AGENTS.md performance_engineering "one build cache per stack" — a discovered fork is disposable derived state.
- Done 2026-07-22: the root test profile now matches the development profile:
  workspace test crates retain line tables, while dependencies, build scripts,
  and procedural macros emit no test debuginfo. This closes the configuration
  path through which Nextest could repopulate the shared cache with full
  symbols.
- Done 2026-07-22: removed two abandoned full-target `du` scans that had
  traversed the cache for about 2.5 hours, then pruned the idle incremental
  tree. Its 27,085 session directories occupied 525,183,672,320 bytes
  (approximately 489 GiB); the five-minute deletion preserved shared
  dependencies and linked artifacts, and a subsequent build recreated only
  three current session directories. This is operational reclamation, not a
  clean-build footprint claim.
- Done 2026-07-22: Kwavers PR #307 merges as `0602c1fd4`. Its broad
  dependency graph inherits development `opt-level = 1` instead of wildcard
  `opt-level = 3`, restoring exported generic sharing. Uncached feature-build
  steps fall 18–45%; exact head `909bcdfc7` passes 26 hosted checks, full-grid
  PSTD remains below 25 seconds, and a clean debug tree measures
  16,771,464,617 bytes across 6,109 files. Cargo removes the formerly blocked
  `repos/kwavers/target_isolated` plus six other obsolete private targets:
  9,363 files and approximately 4.49 GiB, without touching `D:/atlas/target`.
  Atlas-meta format and warning-denied Clippy pass; checkout-path Nextest passes
  11/11 in 3.746 seconds and doctests pass 1/1 in 1.93 seconds from the primary
  root against the shared cache.
- Done 2026-07-22: a stack-wide sweep removed 13 additional disposable target
  forks and reclaimed 18.465 GiB; no repository-local target directory
  remains. Before the remaining hosted checks, `cargo clean` against the
  canonical `D:/atlas/target` removed 68,854 files and 20.7 GiB. The configured
  shared cache then measured 0 bytes, below the 10-GiB operating budget; the
  final sweep must repeat after any later local gate.
- Residual: audit member workspaces with their own `[profile.*]` or `.cargo`
  sections (helios, hermes, CFDrs, coeus, ritk, mnemosyne). CFDrs currently
  compiles workspace tests at `opt-level = 2`; its dirty peer-owned workspace
  and active full test build preclude an unmeasured profile edit. Re-open that
  member as a separate measured increment after the peer work integrates,
  retaining only runtime- or profiling-justified deviations. Atlas-meta root
  worktrees copy `.cargo/config.toml` and therefore resolve a lane-local target;
  run meta-tool verification from the primary root until a portable route to
  the canonical cache is implemented and tested. One live sample found three
  independent top-level builds, five Cargo processes, and 23 concurrent `rustc`
  processes on a 24-thread/31.7-GiB host. Compare unchanged single- and
  concurrent-build workloads before selecting a global jobs cap; the sample
  proves oversubscription exposure, not an optimal cap.
