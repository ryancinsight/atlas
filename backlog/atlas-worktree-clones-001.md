## ATLAS-WORKTREE-CLONES-001 — Reconcile standalone clones under `worktrees/` [patch] — in-progress

- **2026-09-02:** the lane audit's one remaining violation is `worktrees/kwavers-log` — not a clone: an empty folder skeleton (0 files) left by a removed lane, whose `crates/kwavers-python/.pytest_cache` is held open by five live peer processes and refuses deletion. Re-open trigger: those handles release (or a peer session ends); then `rm -rf worktrees/kwavers-log` and the audit reads 0, closing this item and `ATLAS-LANE-AUDIT-001`. Everything else is clean: no standalone clone under `worktrees/`, every member at or under two trees.

- Census 2026-07-30 (mechanized: `scripts/atlas-lane-audit.py`, exit-nonzero local gate for orient/replenishment — filed by fable-prompt-session as peer-assist evidence): 17 hand-wired gitdir mirrors are back under `worktrees/` (aequitas, apollo, coeus, consus, eunomia, gaia, hermes, hyperion, iris, leto, melinoe, mnemosyne, moirai, proteus, ritk, themis, tyche — each `.git` file points at the member's primary `.git/modules/...` gitdir, sharing its index), plus the `worktrees/hephaestus` standalone clone, three bare non-worktree dirs (hephaestus-unary-math-parity, kwavers-aequitas-vessel-metrics, ritk-book-complete), and kwavers at 3 working trees. The prior purge did not hold — something regenerates the mirrors. SPIKE (unclaimed): identify the generator (peer tooling or an agent habit materializing `worktrees/<member>`), evidence budget one session, deliverable = generator named and fixed or a defect filed on its owner; re-deletion without that finding repeats the cycle. Legitimate submodule lanes (gitdir under `.git/modules/<path>/worktrees/<lane>`) pass the audit.
- Live-regeneration evidence 2026-07-30: the violation count moved 22 -> 29 within ~2h of the first audit run — lane-root timestamps show a peer serially creating `hephaestus-j1e2` … `hephaestus-j5` plus `ritk-pr-split` during the session (lane-per-subtask sprawl; the two-tree bound and one-item-per-lane rules ignored). The spike's generator question now has a live specimen: whatever workflow drives the `-jN` series is creating a lane per job. Differential note for auditors: `scripts/atlas-lane-audit.py` counts are environment-dependent by design (local git state) — never baseline them in conformance JSON.
- Evidence: `D:/atlas/worktrees/` holds directories named after stack repos
  (`leto`, `eunomia`, `moirai`, `ritk`, …) that are **standalone clones**, not
  linked worktrees — `worktrees/eunomia/.git` is a full repo directory, and
  `git worktree list` in `repos/eunomia` shows only `repos/eunomia`.
- Impact: this is the prohibited repo-copy pattern (forked history, duplicated
  disk). It also actively breaks lanes: a real worktree placed under
  `worktrees/` resolves a member's `../<repo>` path dependencies to these
  clones, producing `package collision in the lockfile` — encountered while
  trying to lane the kwavers GMRES work.
- Scope: per clone, rescue-commit any dirty state, fetch unique branches and
  commits into the authoritative repo under `repos/`, then delete. Confirm
  `git worktree list` per repo stays within the two-tree bound afterwards.
- Non-goal: touching genuine linked worktrees.

### Session 29 partial reconciliation (2026-07-27)

Inventory at session open: 8 standalone clones (full `.git` dir at
`worktrees/<repo>`): `aequitas`, `asclepius`, `eunomia`, `hephaestus`,
`hermes`, `iris`, `leto`, `themis`.

- **Reconciled and deleted this session**: `worktrees/iris`.
  Safety verification satisfied byte-for-byte: WT HEAD `c3cc43b` ==
  `worktrees/iris`'s `origin/main` == atlas-meta gitlink pin ==
  `repos/iris` HEAD == `repos/iris`'s `origin/main`; zero unpushed commits
  (`origin/main..HEAD` empty); clean WT (no dirty files, no untracked,
  no stashes); single local branch `main`; not a linked worktree
  (`git worktree list` in `repos/iris` lists only the main tree). 3 days
  stale (well past the 1h staleness sweep threshold).
- **Intentionally NOT touched (peer mid-flight or unique content)**:
  - `leto` — last commit 18 min prior to close (actively in flight).
  - `aequitas` — dirty WT (`CHANGELOG.md`, `Cargo.lock`, `README.md`,
    `src/systems/si/*.rs`, `tests/*.rs`), 5h staleness. Mid-flight peer work;
    deletion would trigger `interaction_policy` Ask-User (irreversible loss
    of uncommitted unique work).
  - `themis` — dirty `Cargo.toml` containing **ATLAS-PATH-DEP-AUDIT-2 /
    ATLAS-OVERLAY-001 generated `[patch]` overlay content** (comment
    `Last delivery: 2026-07-27 closure cycle`). This is the peer-attributed
    draft of the ATLAS-OVERLAY-001 deliverable; deletion would destroy
    unique peer-authored state.
  - `asclepius`, `eunomia`, `hephaestus`, `hermes` — 6h staleness,
    not exhaustively safety-verified this session. Hephaestus clone HEAD
    matches the active peer-hephaestus feature branch, currently the focus
    of the persistent `no-origin-main` defect.
- **Next-session action**: re-safety-verify the 6h-stale and 3-day-stale
  clones (`asclepius`, `eunomia`, `hermes`) using the iris verification
  protocol (HEAD == origin/main AND clean WT AND no local-only branches AND
  no unpushed commits AND not a linked worktree) and delete each that passes.
  `aequitas` and `themis` require the user or the owning peer to rescue the
  dirty state before the clone can be deleted. `leto` is freshly active and
  should not be touched.
