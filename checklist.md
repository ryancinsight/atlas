# Moirai Development Checklist

**Target**: Unreleased

## gap-audit-2026-08-20 (owner: atlas-gap-audit)

Execution order for the audit items filed in `docs/backlog.md` under
"Gap audit 2026-08-20". Static audit only at HEAD `95891f6`; no gate was run, so
every step below begins by establishing its own entry baseline.

Ordered by "closes a hole in the gate" first, then evidence depth, then hygiene.
Steps 1-4 are independent and may be claimed by different agents on disjoint
scopes; steps 5-9 depend on nothing but touch shared documentation, so claim them
one at a time.

- [ ] 1. MOI-AUDIT-VER-003 — add the six unenforced loom targets to the `loom` job
      in `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml:110-116`. Smallest CI diff, largest
      evidence gain: it makes the README's exhaustive-Chase-Lev claim a gated
      fact. Confirm the job still fits `timeout-minutes: 10`; if not, re-derive
      and record the budget rather than dropping a target.
- [ ] 2. MOI-AUDIT-VER-002 — add the nightly `miri` job. Scope it to the crates
      whose unsafe Miri can execute and state the exclusions in the job body;
      never claim coverage for the PAL FFI or SIMD intrinsic paths.
- [ ] 3. MOI-AUDIT-SEC-001 — add `fuzz/` targets for `moirai-http/src/codec.rs`
      and `moirai-transport/src/remote_task.rs`, then deny
      `clippy::indexing_slicing` and `clippy::arithmetic_side_effects` in those
      two crates. Run each target over a malformed corpus before claiming green.
- [ ] 4. MOI-AUDIT-VER-004 — extend the `gate` job to `macos-latest` and
      `windows-latest` so `moirai-pal/src/unix/kqueue.rs` and
      `moirai-pal/src/windows/poll.rs` compile and test somewhere. Expect first-run
      failures in code no CI has ever built; those are the point of the item.
- [ ] 5. MOI-AUDIT-DOC-005 — write `docs/adr/0015-native-http-transport-stack.md`
      (Accepted, retroactive, grounded in the shipped `moirai-crypto`/`-tls`/`-http`
      code and `docs/adr-015-checklist.md`), then verify all six citation sites
      resolve.
- [ ] 6. MOI-AUDIT-PM-008 — restore `scripts/adr-index.py` and wire its `check`
      into CI, or delete the generated-by header at `docs/adr/README.md:3-5`.
      Sequence after step 5 so the 0015 row lands with the fix.
- [ ] 7. MOI-AUDIT-FLOOR-012 — deny `missing_docs` in `moirai-core`, `moirai-gpu`,
      `moirai-crypto`, `moirai-python`; convert the 32 crate-level blanket
      `#![allow(clippy::...)]` attributes to counted `[workspace.lints.clippy]`
      lines or per-site `#[expect(..., reason = ...)]`. Expect the workspace
      ratchet counts to rise as crate-local allows stop hiding sites — record the
      new true baseline rather than re-allowing.
- [ ] 8. MOI-AUDIT-VER-006 — stand up the unannotated-unsafe scan as a
      non-increasing ratchet, then burn `moirai-scheduler`, `moirai-core`, and
      `moirai-async` to zero. Sequence after step 2 so Miri checks what the
      annotations assert.
- [ ] 9. MOI-AUDIT-VER-011, MOI-AUDIT-VER-010, MOI-AUDIT-DOC-009,
      MOI-AUDIT-PM-007 — bench budget, property coverage, book chapters for the
      route and transport layers, and the PM single-owner consolidation. The PM
      consolidation is last because it moves paths the earlier steps cite.

Audit evidence and per-item acceptance oracles: `docs/backlog.md`, section
"Gap audit 2026-08-20 — scope vs delivery".

## MOI-PACKAGE-REPRO-001 — self-contained workspace packaging [patch] — complete

- [x] Add explicit `0.5.0` requirements to the benchmark and integration-test
      path dependencies so Cargo can package the unpublished harnesses.
- [x] Move the runtime examples under `moirai/examples/`, point every
      `[[example]]` target and documentation link at the crate-owned files, and
      set the facade README path to the package-local README.
- [x] Complete binding and harness package metadata and update the route
      contract assertion for the versioned transport dependency.
- Evidence: standalone `cargo package --workspace --locked` packages and
      verifies every workspace member with no warnings; pinned Clippy passes
      with `-D warnings`, Nextest passes `801/801` with 6 configured skips,
      doctests pass with 1 ignored case, and workspace rustdoc completes.

## MOI-SCHED-EXACT-002 — Chase-Lev slot ownership [patch] — complete

- [x] Claim each slot generation before moving a non-`Copy` value so a thief
      cannot race owner reuse of a wrapped ring slot; publish the correct
      generation for bottom pops and advance it for steals.
- [x] Quiesce thief accesses during resize and copy generation state with live
      values while retaining the allocation-free `MaybeUninit` storage contract.
- [x] Add a non-`Copy` drop-count regression and update the artificial
      index-wrap fixture to initialize generation state through the test seam.
- [x] Use strong arbitration CAS operations so `Retry` reports contention,
      not a permitted weak-CAS spurious failure, at single-steal contracts.
- Evidence: pinned Moirai scheduler nextest passes 27/27, including resize,
      index wrapping, single- and eight-thief exactly-once contention, batch
      contention, split-deque consumers, and non-`Copy` drop accounting.
      Pinned warning-denied Clippy passes for all scheduler targets, and the
      pinned Loom Chase-Lev model passes 1/1. Nightly Miri passes all 16
      deque-focused unit tests, including the panic-repair memmove; the full
      19-test crate invocation reaches the remaining NUMA test, which calls
      Themis' Windows NUMA FFI unsupported by Miri.

## ATLAS-MOIRAI-AUDIT-076 — Isolated provider re-verification — closed 2026-08-16

- [x] Re-run the locked workspace gate set from an isolated checkout at the
      current provider head and record exact results in `GAP_ANALYSIS.md`.
- [x] Reconcile release and trusted-publisher status with the existing
      provider boundaries; do not represent the external PyPI account blocker
      as a code defect or release completion.
- [x] Complete the provider-local audit documentation and hosted checks.
      Local gates are green; hosted validation remains the release boundary.

## ATLAS-MOIRAI-BOOK-TEST-2026-08-20 — executable book examples [patch] — in progress

- [x] Enable the shared Pages workflow's `mdbook-test` path with Rust `1.97.0`
      and `cargo-package: moirai-runtime`.
- [x] Add explicit `extern crate moirai;` declarations to both included book
      example sources so rustdoc can resolve the staged facade library.
- Evidence: format, locked runtime example check, example Clippy with
      `-D warnings`, and `mdbook build` pass locally. PR #144 at `4d9bfb0` has
      hosted Rust, Python, and Pages jobs queued; clean hosted execution is the
      acceptance gate because the shared Windows target mixes historical rlibs.

## MOI-SEC-077 — dependency advisory closure — open residuals

- [x] Upgrade the direct PyO3 dependency from `0.22.6` to `0.29.2`, replace
      the removed `Python::allow_threads` API with `Python::detach`, and pass
      the full Rust workspace gate.
- [x] Remove the unused benchmark-only `statistical` dependency and its
      deprecated `rand_os` transitive chain.
- [x] Add `deny.toml` and a pinned supply-chain CI job. The configured check
      passes advisories, bans, licenses, and sources; duplicate-version and
      workspace path-dependency wildcard diagnostics remain warnings.
- [x] Align the pinned action annotation with cargo-deny-action 2.1.1 and set
      `unused-ignored-advisory = "deny"` with structured residual reasons;
      cargo-deny 0.20.2 passes the locked graph with both residual advisories
      encountered and no unused-ignore diagnostics.
- [ ] Replace or remove RSA signing and verification before exposing it to an
      attacker-observable service. `rsa 0.9.10` remains under
      `RUSTSEC-2023-0071`; no safe upstream release exists, so the advisory is
      an explicit cargo-deny residual rather than a hidden pass.
- [ ] Replace the indirect `paste` dependency pulled by the wgpu Metal stack
      when a safe upstream route exists (`RUSTSEC-2024-0436`).

## MOI-CI-EXACT-001 — exact-head Rust and Loom verification [patch] — complete

- [x] Dispatch the committed Rust workflow against the Atlas-pinned provider
      head `a6337abe7fee865d92872c1364d3870a8ee398f1`.
- [x] Verify both the workspace gate and Loom channel models at that exact
      head.
- Evidence: hosted Rust Workspace run `31870317060` passed both `Workspace
  gate` and `Loom channel models` at the exact provider head. The Atlas
  gitlink already matches this head; no pointer change is required.

## MOI-INTERLEAVED-065 — event-synchronized execution coverage [patch] — complete

- Owner: Codex on `test/moirai-interleaved-synchronization`.
- [x] Replace sleep/poll synchronization and wall-clock performance assertions
      in `tests/src/interleaved_execution_tests.rs` with task joins and bounded
      completion channels.
- [x] Exercise the interleaved error result branch and assert the exact
      success/error partition; retain exact work, cascade-stage, and resource
      integrity assertions.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and configured Nextest
  `-p moirai-tests interleaved_execution_tests::` pass, 6/6 tests. The test
  module contains no `std::thread::sleep`, `Instant`, or wall-clock polling.

## MOI-MNEMOSYNE-PACKAGE-1 — package identity [patch] — complete

- Owner: Codex on `codex/moirai-mnemosyne-package`.
- [x] Bind the facade and core aliases to their `mnemosyne-memory` package
      identities.
- [x] Refresh dependency resolution and pass the focused core check.

## MOI-THEMIS-PACKAGE-1 — package identity [patch] — complete

- Owner: Codex on `codex/moirai-themis-package`.
- [x] Bind `themis` to package `themis-topology` 0.10.1.
- [x] Refresh dependency resolution and pass focused gates.
- [x] Merge before rerunning dependent Hephaestus provider CI.

## MOI-NUMA-002 — facade NUMA policy reaches the scheduler [minor] [arch] — complete

- Owner: Codex on `codex/moirai-numa-policy`.
- [x] Forward the facade `numa_aware` value through the core and executor
      feature seams.
- [x] Preserve topology-aware defaults and make explicit disablement skip
      worker-node assignment construction.
- [x] Add facade configuration and scheduler assignment regressions.
- [x] Synchronize README, changelog, backlog, and ADR-027.
- [x] Pass the exact default-head hosted Rust workspace gate.
- Evidence: local formatting, standalone locked metadata, warning-denied
  Clippy, configured Nextest 118/118 with two configured skips, seven
  doctests, and warning-denied rustdoc pass. Default-head Rust Workspace run
  `31787962637` and Python Bindings run `31787962649` pass at merge commit
  `38e936a`.

## MOI-THEMIS-CPU-001 — provider-owned CPU topology [patch] — complete

- Owner: Codex; delivered through PR #118 and merged as `57c4ec4`.
- Scope: default worker-count and chunk-sizing decisions in `moirai-core`,
  `moirai-executor`, `moirai-iter`, `moirai-parallel`, and
  `moirai-scheduler`; benchmark contract fixes are delivered separately under
  ISSUE-216.
- [x] Route each default CPU-count decision through Themis topology detection
      with the existing standard-library fallback preserved.
- [x] Add value-semantic partition-order coverage for the Melinoe-backed
      parallel adapter.
- [x] Pass focused all-target checks, warning-denied Clippy, configured
      Nextest (430/430 across the affected crates and 68/68 benchmarks),
      doctests, and rustdoc.
- [x] Replace host-dependent priority timing and worker-blocking ABA test
      synchronization with event-gated queue coverage and joined task results;
      the complete `moirai-tests` package passes 36/36 under Nextest.
- [x] Merge PR #118 after the hosted required checks passed, then advance the
      Atlas gitlink to the exact current default head `2f639dc`.

## MOI-CI-224 — Rust workspace gate [patch] — complete

- Owner: Codex on `codex/fix-atlas-sha`.
- [x] Add a pull-request and main-branch Rust workspace gate for formatting,
      warning-denied Clippy, configured Nextest, doctests, and rustdoc.
- [x] Pin all third-party actions to commit SHAs, constrain permissions, and
      bound the job runtime.
- [x] Verify the gate commands locally against the affected workspace packages.
- [x] Restore standalone Git source records for the Melinoe, all six Mnemosyne,
      and Themis packages in `Cargo.lock`; the hosted diagnostic also refreshed
      the stale registry checksums and versions required by the current graph.
- [x] Remove all `[[patch.unused]]` records emitted only by the Atlas
      development overlay; the standalone lock must contain no overlay state.
- [x] Confirm the hosted workflow is green after the standalone lock refresh and
      deterministic test repair: Rust Workspace run `31566422283` passed at
      `9ec4b02`; current default documentation, Python, and Pages workflows
      pass at `2f639dc`.

## MOI-PAR-062 — borrowing parallel scope [minor] — complete

- Provider acceptance is complete; the borrowing scope facade, direct
  `moirai-core` ownership, higher-ranked lifetime bound, borrowed completion,
  return-value coverage, and focused local/hosted gates are all delivered.
  No downstream consumer pin is pending for this item.

- Owner: Codex `/root` (composed from preserved peer work).
- Scope: the `moirai-parallel` borrowing scope facade, its direct dependency
  ownership, value-semantic tests, and release documentation.
- Acceptance: multiple tasks borrow caller-owned values, complete before the
  scope returns, preserve a body return value, and compile without exposing an
  escaping scheduler lifetime.
- [x] Preserve and complete the peer's public scope facade.
- [x] Add direct `moirai-core` ownership and the higher-ranked lifetime bound.
- [x] Add borrowed completion and return-value coverage.
- [x] Pass focused local and exact-head hosted gates; merge Moirai.

## MOI-SCHED-061 — bounded indexed admission [patch] — provider and downstream complete

- Owner: Codex `/root` (stale-peer takeover after one hour without a write or
  commit in the claimed scope).
- Scope: indexed scheduler admission, its diagnostics and value-semantic
  saturation tests, release documentation, and the downstream Kwavers
  serialization workaround. Other scheduler policies are non-goals.
- Acceptance: a full worker admission queue executes each rejected indexed
  chunk exactly once on the caller, map-reduce preserves the mathematical
  result, caller-run panics become `SpawnFailed(Panicked)` only after scheduled
  scope work drains, the scheduler remains reusable, and the recovery event is
  observable without allocating on the healthy path.
- [x] Preserve the stale peer's caller-runs intent.
- [x] Add one shared panic boundary for inline indexed work.
- [x] Add a relaxed monotonic admission diagnostic.
- [x] Add deterministic saturated fan-out, reduction, panic, and reuse coverage.
- [x] Pass focused local and exact-head hosted gates; merge Moirai.
- [x] Downstream-only follow-up: Kwavers consumed the merged Moirai pin and
      closed the admission-specific serialization workaround in `KW-CI-068`.
      The broader architecture workflow may still use `--test-threads=1` for
      unrelated workload isolation; that is not an admission workaround.
      This does not block the completed Moirai provider implementation.
- [x] Provider hygiene follow-up: document the scheduler diagnostics surface,
      add the module-level allowance required by the pinned Melinoe 0.9.0
      `thread_cached!` expansion, and preserve the shared-provider boundary
      without a local cache duplicate.
- Evidence (2026-08-06): rustfmt, diff check, all-target/all-feature check,
      warning-denied Clippy, workspace Nextest **784/784** (6 configured
      skips), doctests, `moirai-parallel` **32/32**, and
      `moirai-executor` **91/91** (1 configured skip) pass offline. The
      scheduler wait test passed in the definitive run; an earlier isolated
      failure was non-reproducible across five focused retries and is retained
      as a stability watchpoint rather than hidden.

## MOI-REL-061 — Rust crate releases [patch] — in progress

- Owner: Codex `/root`.
- Scope: collision-free facade identity, published Mnemosyne package aliases,
  registry metadata, locked archives, and crates.io release automation.
- Acceptance: every reusable workspace crate packages from a clean checkout,
  publishes in dependency order, resolves from crates.io, and uses the OIDC
  release workflow for subsequent versions.
- [x] Select the available `moirai-runtime` facade package identity while
  preserving `use moirai::...` for Rust consumers.
- [x] Bind Mnemosyne dependencies to their registry package identities.
- [x] Pass the clean-checkout metadata and workspace nextest gates.
- [ ] Publish every reusable workspace crate and verify the sparse index.
- [ ] Register each crates.io Trusted Publisher against the release workflow.

## MOI-REL-060 — Python wheel releases [patch] — blocked

- Owner: Codex `/root`.
- Scope: `moirai-python` distribution metadata and documentation, a pinned
  cross-platform release workflow, the protected GitHub publishing
  environment, release-facing root documentation, the Linux shared-memory
  size boundary that blocks the binding gate, and this owner-keyed entry.
  Other native runtime behavior and workspace crates are non-goals.
- Acceptance: a GitHub Release tagged `moirai-python-v<version>` builds locked
  wheels for supported CPython versions on Linux, Windows, and macOS; installs
  and imports each wheel; validates distribution metadata against the tag;
  attests and attaches the exact artifacts to the GitHub Release; and publishes
  those same wheels to PyPI through GitHub OIDC.
- [x] Make Cargo the Python distribution version source of truth.
- [x] Add pinned cross-platform wheel CI and release workflows.
- [x] Synchronize Python, root, changelog, toolchain, and Nextest contracts.
- [x] Build, install, import, and exercise a production wheel locally.
- [x] Pass workflow lint and focused Rust/Python binding gates.
- [x] Protect the `pypi` environment with the `moirai-python-v*` tag policy.
- [x] Pass exact-head hosted CI.
- [x] Merge the release PR.
- [ ] Register the PyPI pending trusted publisher after account verification.
- Blocker: PyPI rejects `ryanclanton@outlook.com`; registration reopens when
  the account has a PyPI-accepted email address and completes verification.
- Evidence: checksum-verified actionlint 1.7.12 accepts both workflows; locked
  Cargo metadata and Rust 1.95 formatting, warning-denied all-target Clippy,
  configured Nextest 1/1, doctests, and warning-clean rustdoc pass. A locked
  CPython 3.13 wheel builds as `moirai-python` 0.4.0, installs into an isolated
  environment, imports, reports the requested two-worker native lifecycle, and
  passes both Python tests. GitHub environment `pypi` accepts only
  `moirai-python-v*` tags. Hosted run `29799529159` then exposed an unchecked
  Unix `usize`-to-`off_t` conversion in `moirai-core`; the owner-local fix
  validates zero and out-of-domain lengths before acquiring a shared-memory
  descriptor and covers both boundaries through the public `SharedMemory`
  contract. The Windows host passes warning-denied all-target core Clippy and
  70/70 configured Nextest cases. Replacement hosted run `29800011266` passes
  the Windows wheel job and exposes a pre-existing unconditional non-Linux
  `AtomicBool` import in the Linux binding closure; that import is now
  target-gated. Exact-head hosted run `29800253930` passes formatting,
  warning-denied binding lint, native binding and Unix shared-memory boundary
  tests, binding doctests, and all three production wheel build/install/import
  smoke jobs. PR #82 carries the merge-ready delivery. PyPI publisher
  registration remains blocked on account verification.

## MOI-SCOPE-059 — scoped multi-job memory safety [patch] — done

- Owner: Codex Tyche integration.
- Scope: `moirai-executor/src/schedule/{job,runtime/scheduler}` and focused
  scoped-dispatch regression coverage.
- [x] Reproduce Tyche's multi-job borrowed-slice access violation without
      Tyche.
- [x] Publish the final zero count while holding the wait lock, and require
      both caller and worker waiters to acquire that lock before destroying the
      stack-owned scope state.
- [x] Verify the 64-round borrowed-chunk regression, the bounded one-completion
      Loom model, and the complete executor package.
- Evidence: configured Nextest passes `moirai-executor` 88/88 with one
  cfg-gated skip; warning-denied all-target/all-feature Clippy, rustfmt,
  doctests, and rustdoc pass. The bounded Loom model passes 1/1. Miri cannot
  reach the regression on Windows because Themis NUMA detection calls the
  unsupported `GetNumaHighestNodeNumber` FFI; it reports no result for this
  invariant. PR 81 contains the delivery; Moirai has no repository engineering
  workflow beyond the non-gating Copilot workflow.

## Moirai 0.4.0 release artifact closure [patch]

- [x] Take over the stale release-artifact increment after one hour without
      file or commit activity.
- [x] Synchronize the workspace version, changelog release section, checklist
      target, and benchmark artifact contract at 0.4.0.
- [x] Verify the focused artifact contract, formatting, and warning-denied
      benchmark test target before publication.
- Evidence: configured Nextest passes the artifact contract 1/1 with 67
  unrelated cases filtered; nightly rustfmt and warning-denied Clippy for the
  benchmark contract target pass.

## MOI-ASYNC-058 — synchronization stabilization [patch]

- [x] Take over the stale uncommitted synchronization/codec lane on `main`.
  Scope: `moirai-async/src/sync/{broadcast,mpsc,wait_queue}.rs`, timer
  regression coverage, `moirai-http/src/codec.rs`, affected examples, and this
  provider PM scope.
- [x] Verify FIFO/cancellation behavior, broadcast retention, and the
  cancellation-compaction regression through value-semantic configured Nextest
  coverage; run warning-denied Clippy and formatter checks before publication.
- [x] Absorb audit findings into the provider backlog/gap register and delete
  the untracked report instead of retaining a parallel status artifact.
- Evidence: configured Nextest passes `moirai-async` 88/88 and `moirai-http`
  9/9; warning-denied workspace Clippy, rustfmt, rustdoc, and doctests pass.

## Provider default-source convergence [major]

- [x] Remove direct Themis, Mnemosyne, and Melinoe revisions plus the local
  Melinoe patch from the workspace dependency SSOT.
- [x] Record ADR-033 (recorded as ADR 016 before the duplicate-number
  resolution): merged Mnemosyne 0.5/Core 0.2 requires Rust 1.95, so the
  workspace advances from 0.3.1 to 0.4.0 without a compatibility branch.
- [x] Refresh the lockfile against merged provider heads and prove one source
  identity for Melinoe, Themis, and Mnemosyne.
- [x] Verify the focused GPU consumer with Rust 1.95 compilation,
  warning-denied Clippy, configured Nextest, doctests, and rustdoc.
- [x] [patch] Preserve SPSC send-before-close ordering with a value-semantic
  drain regression that contains no wall-clock synchronization.
- Evidence: Rust 1.95 accepts `moirai-gpu` and Rust 1.94 rejects the declared
  package graph; warning-denied focused Clippy passes; Nextest passes 10/10;
  doctests pass 0/0; rustdoc is warning-clean; each provider resolves to one
  lock source identity; the SemVer major comparison reports no API check
  failures.

## Phase 31: Channel ordering model coverage

- [x] Re-audit the ordering residual: the MPMC waiter model already landed in
  `moirai-core/tests/loom_mpmc_waiter.rs` at `2ea17bb`; the missing primitive
  is the SPSC ring's publication/reclamation model.
- [x] Add the bounded capacity-two SPSC model with three messages, explicit
  release/acquire head/tail edges, value-semantic FIFO assertions, and a
  recorded preemption bound of four.
- [x] Add a hosted `Loom channel models` job that runs both MPMC and SPSC
  models under `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg loom` with the locked release profile.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes locally. The Atlas overlay
  prevents the locked local metadata gate from running because preserved local
  first-party patches do not match this provider's committed lock; hosted CI
  is the authoritative clean-checkout oracle for the model job.

## Phase 32: Async wake deduplication ordering

- [x] [patch] Replace the async executor's `is_queued` `SeqCst` clear/swap with
  Relaxed operations. The flag only linearizes enqueue deduplication; the
  queue's slot sequence publishes task ownership with Release/Acquire.
- [x] Add `moirai-async/tests/loom_wake_dedup.rs`, exhaustively covering the
  dequeue/clear versus wake/swap race and asserting no duplicate or lost queue
  entry.
- [x] Extend the hosted Loom job to run the async executor model with the
  existing MPMC and SPSC models.
- Evidence: PR #131 merged at default `fd517fe`; exact-head workspace/Loom run
  `31800148163` and bindings/wheels run `31800148178` pass. The completion
  guard remains Acquire/Release and scheduler/MPMC protocols are unchanged.

## Phase 33: PAL reactor stop-flag ordering

- [x] [patch] Reduce `IoReactor::running` start, loop, and stop accesses from
  `SeqCst` to Relaxed. The flag carries only loop-control state; `stop()` keeps
  its independent platform wake operation for progress from a blocked poll.
- [x] Verify the focused reactor and async network stop paths through the
  hosted workspace and binding/wheel gates.
- Evidence: PR #132 merged at default `8830f1b`; exact-head workspace/Loom run
  `31800607186` and bindings/wheels run `31800607152` pass. The provider exact
  head has no production `SeqCst` accesses in
  `moirai-pal/src/reactor/core.rs`.

## Phase 34: Connection-pool reservation ordering

- [x] [patch] Reduce `ConnectionPool::reserved_connections` admission and
  release accounting to Relaxed operations. Admission serialization remains
  under the active-connections mutex, and every reservation increment has one
  paired decrement.
- [x] Add the bounded Loom model covering two serialized admissions racing one
  paired cancellation, with capacity and final-accounting assertions.
- [x] Verify the exact provider head through the workspace/Loom and
  bindings/wheel gates.
- Evidence: PR #133 merged at default `f766c6d`; exact-head workspace/Loom run
  `31801180700` and bindings/wheels run `31801180691` pass.

## Phase 30: NUMA helper removal and channel hierarchy closure

- [x] [major] Delete the unconsumed `moirai_iter::numa` API and its obsolete
  Rayon comparison benchmark. Themis owns placement, Mnemosyne owns allocation,
  and `moirai-parallel` owns scheduler-backed data-parallel work; no source
  consumer imports the removed iterator helper.
- [x] [patch] Split hybrid and MPMC channel implementation into vertical state,
  send, receive, future, and test modules. `HybridChannel<T>` is a zero-sized
  factory; endpoint halves own each live synchronization primitive.
- Evidence: `cargo nextest run -p moirai-core` 69/69;
  `-p moirai-iter` 185/185 (2 cfg-skips); `-p moirai-benchmarks` 68/68;
  warning-denied `moirai-core` Clippy; and formatter checks pass. This is
  compile-time/API-surface and value-semantic test evidence, not a throughput
  claim.

## Phase 29: Indexed caller-region flattening

- [x] [patch] Mark the caller lane while it participates in indexed fan-out
  and map/reduce so nested regions flatten on every outer lane, not only
  scheduler workers.
- [x] Verify exact caller/worker lane identity and value sums through nextest,
  then run warning-denied Clippy.
- [x] Pin the commit in RITK and pass the unchanged masked-CMA consumer gate.
- Evidence: `cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor` passed 83/83 with one
  cfg-gated skip; warning-denied all-target/all-feature Clippy passed. RITK
  pins merged Moirai main in its Atlas checkout action, and `cargo nextest run
  -p ritk-registration masked_cache --all-features --status-level fail` passes.

## Phase 28: Melinoe executor capability migration

- [x] [major] Construct Melinoe's validated `ParallelExecutor` next to the real
  Moirai scheduler bridge with an explicit exact-once, completion, and lifetime
  safety proof.
- [x] [major] Remove the raw function-pointer registration call and update the
  workspace Melinoe contract to 0.9.0 and Mnemosyne facade to 0.3.0.
- [x] Verify the real Melinoe routing path plus Moirai executor Clippy, 83/83
  nextest (one cfg-gated test skipped), doctests, and rustdoc against Melinoe
  `bb07447`, Themis `6140468`, and Mnemosyne 0.3.0 at `df2994f`.

## Phase 27: GPU pollster boundary removal
- [x] [patch] Added `moirai_executor::block_on` as the Moirai-owned
  current-thread parking wait primitive for synchronous async boundaries.
- [x] [patch] Replaced `moirai-gpu`'s `GpuTaskAdapter` `pollster::block_on`
  call with `moirai_executor::block_on` and removed `pollster` from the
  `wgpu-backend` feature dependency list.
- [x] [patch] Added a benchmark source contract that rejects reintroducing
  `pollster` into `moirai-gpu`'s manifest or task adapter.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly rustfmt --edition 2021
  moirai-executor\src\lib.rs moirai-gpu\src\task.rs
  benchmarks\tests\benchmark_contracts\source_contracts.rs`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-gpu --features wgpu-backend`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --no-default-features`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo tree -p moirai-gpu --features wgpu-backend -i
  pollster` reports no matching package; `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run
  -p moirai-benchmarks gpu_task_adapter_uses_moirai_block_on_not_pollster
  --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1.

## Phase 26: Socket stale-wake regression ✅
- [x] [patch] Added a real loopback TCP regression for the July 2 stale-wake
  async bug: `timeout(stream.read(...))` completes through the timer while the
  socket read waker remains registered, then peer readability wakes the stale
  reactor slot after the async task has completed.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-async
  timeout_read_stale_socket_wake_does_not_repoll_completed_task
  --status-level fail --no-fail-fast`.

## Phase 25: Transport stale export cleanup
- [x] [patch] Removed `moirai_transport::core_zero_copy`, a stale re-export of
  deleted `moirai_core::communication::zero_copy`, so Atlas consumers compile
  against the current `moirai_core::communication` surface.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-transport --check`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-transport`.

## Phase 24: Stateful Chunk Parallel Provider API ✅
- [x] [patch] Added `moirai_parallel::for_each_chunk_mut_with_state` so
  consumers can run mutable chunk kernels with one reusable scratch state per
  scheduled worker shard.
- [x] [patch] Re-exported the API from `moirai-parallel` and covered it with a
  value-semantic test that proves every chunk is written from reusable state.
- [x] [patch] Added `for_each_chunk_triple_mut_enumerated_with` and
  `for_each_chunk_quad_mut_enumerated_with` for provider-owned fused updates
  across three or four equal-length mutable output buffers.
- [x] [patch] Re-exported the multi-output chunk APIs and covered them with
  value-semantic tests that prove chunk indices and all output buffers are
  written from the caller-provided closure.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt -p moirai-parallel --check`; `cargo check -p
  moirai-parallel`; `cargo nextest run -p moirai-parallel
  for_each_chunk_ --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` (6/6).

## Phase 23: Task Registry Stable Slot Access ✅
- [x] [patch] Kept `TaskStateBlock` slot storage private behind
  `UnsafeCell`-based `get`/`insert`/`clear`/`states` methods so lifecycle
  tokens receive stable `NonNull<TaskState>` pointers without exposing block
  internals.
- [x] [patch] Routed registry production paths, diagnostics, active/completed
  counts, and cleanup through the block accessor API.
- [x] [patch] Updated benchmark source-contract assertions to pin the dense
  `UnsafeCell<Option<TaskState>>` representation and zero-allocation stable-slot
  invariant.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor` (61/61, 1 skipped);
  `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-executor --no-deps`.

## Phase 22: Sharded Task Registry ✅
- [x] [patch] Replaced the hybrid executor's single `Arc<Mutex<TaskRegistry>>`
  with `Arc<ShardedTaskRegistry>` so task registration and metadata reads route
  through per-shard registry locks.
- [x] [patch] Added sharded registry coverage proving dense global IDs,
  global-to-local metadata reporting, lifecycle-token completion, and unknown
  task lookup behavior.
- [x] [patch] Updated manager status/stat/wait paths to use the sharded
  registry facade directly and removed stale warning sources.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor` (62/62, 1 skipped);
  `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-executor --no-deps`; `git diff
  --check`.

## Phase 21: Executor Lockfile and Rustdoc Hygiene ✅
- [x] [patch] Synchronized `Cargo.lock` with the existing `cfg(loom)`
  `moirai-executor` dev-dependency so locked builds resolve the model-checking
  dependency edge.
- [x] [patch] Removed redundant explicit `WorkScheduler` Rustdoc link targets
  from `moirai-executor::hybrid`, keeping the package rustdoc gate
  warning-clean.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo test --doc -p moirai-executor`; `rustup run nightly cargo doc
  -p moirai-executor --no-deps`; `git diff --check`.

## Phase 20: Async RwLock Waiter Map ✅
- [x] [patch] Completed the `moirai-async::sync::RwLock` waiter storage
  migration from `VecDeque` tuples to keyed `BTreeMap<u64, RwWaiter>` state.
- [x] [patch] Routed read/write future poll, cancellation, writer grant, and
  reader-batch wakeup through the same waiter state so the O(log n) removal
  contract compiles and preserves FIFO-by-monotonic-id handoff.
- [x] [patch] Fixed the `ConnectionId` Rustdoc peer-address link to
  `std::net::SocketAddr`, keeping rustdoc warning-clean.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-async --check`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo check -p moirai-async --all-targets`; `rustup run nightly cargo
  clippy -p moirai-async --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-async`; `rustup run nightly cargo test
  --doc -p moirai-async`; `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-async
  --all-features --no-deps`; `git diff --check`.

## Phase 19: Concurrent Stream Module Export ✅
- [x] [minor] Completed the `parallel_stream` -> `stream` module rename by
  exporting `moirai_iter::stream` from `moirai-iter`.
- [x] [minor] Renamed the stream extension trait and methods to
  `ConcurrentStreamExt` / `concurrent_*`, matching the bounded-concurrency
  contract rather than promising CPU parallelism for every async item future.
- [x] [minor] Added fused `concurrent_filter_map` and `concurrent_filter`
  stream adapters with value-semantic coverage.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt --check -p moirai-iter`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-iter
  --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `cargo nextest run -p
  moirai-iter stream` -> 10 passed; `cargo doc -p moirai-iter --all-features
  --no-deps`.

## Phase 18: Default Provider Feature Contract
- [x] [patch] Added default `parallel` and `mnemosyne-memory` features to every
  Moirai package. Existing Mnemosyne-backed crates forward `mnemosyne-memory`
  to the established `mnemosyne` provider feature; non-provider leaf crates use
  zero-dependency markers.
- [x] [patch] Applied rustfmt-required import/closure formatting in existing
  Moirai iterator/reactor files so the formatting gate is clean.
- Evidence: `cargo metadata --no-deps --locked --format-version 1`; full Atlas
  feature-policy metadata audit; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.
  Residual: compile/test gates were blocked before rustc by denied access to
  `target/debug/.cargo-lock`.

## Phase 17: Mnemosyne Worker Maintenance Integration ✅
- [x] Registered Moirai's global scheduler as Melinoe's `std` partition executor via pushed Melinoe commit `8140882`, so branded partition writes route through Moirai workers.
- [x] Added a value-semantic scheduler test proving Melinoe partition routing writes every branded cell exactly once through the registered Moirai executor.
- [x] Removed dead thread-local cache declaration from `moirai-core::pool::GlobalPool::get`; the active implementation uses the global pool path.
- [x] Added `mnemosyne` as an optional `moirai-executor` dependency and default feature.
- [x] Forwarded the top-level `moirai/mnemosyne` feature into `moirai-executor/mnemosyne`.
- [x] Routed idle worker-loop maintenance through `mnemosyne::Mnemosyne` defragmentation sweeps using the provider's top-level backend selector.
- [x] Updated Moirai's Mnemosyne pin to `938d0c2bc094d3bbe7745d68d60e05a531e0cfc2` so the executor consumes the exported provider selector.
- [x] Verification: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p moirai --locked`; `cargo test -p moirai-executor --features mnemosyne --locked`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-executor -p moirai --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`.
- Evidence: compiler diagnostics, value-semantic scheduler/executor tests under the Mnemosyne feature, and clippy diagnostics.

## Phase 16: Default Parallel Branding Integration ✅
- [x] Enabled `moirai-parallel` Mellinoe integration by default so the parallel crate exposes branded partitioning without opt-in feature plumbing.
- [x] Added `melinoe` to the `moirai` facade default feature set alongside existing `parallel` and `mnemosyne` defaults.
- [x] Replaced serial async iterator map/filter/for_each execution with bounded concurrent polling while preserving ordered map/filter results.
- [x] Verification: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo test -p moirai-iter execution::tests::async_context --locked`; `cargo test -p moirai-parallel -p moirai --locked`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-iter -p moirai-parallel -p moirai --all-targets -- -D warnings`; `cargo test --locked --workspace --examples`.
- Evidence: value-semantic async ordering tests, Mellinoe partitioning tests under default features, clippy diagnostics, and workspace example execution.

## ATLAS-MOIRAI-SEQCST-SLICE-2026-08-21 - current session

- [x] Take over the dead Moirai primary checkout (35h stale, upstream gone):
      uncommitted Step-4 timeouts overlay, PM deltas, and an LF .gitattributes
      candidate archived under worktrees/.archive/moirai-dead-checkout-20260821/;
      checkout reset clean to origin/main ff56d60.
- [x] Remove the two stray detached kwavers trees at D:/tmp (kw-main2,
      kw-verify); both clean with commits reachable on pushed origin branches.
      Four canonical-root kwavers lanes and leto-stage-d remain untouched:
      measured-fresh live-peer territory, watchpoint recorded.
- [x] Open canonical lane worktrees/moirai-seqcst-relax from fetched
      origin/main; claim ATLAS-MOIRAI-ORDERING-052.
- [ ] Land the archived Step-4 timeouts overlay as a proper provider commit
      (defaults.run.timeout-minutes 30 on python-ci/python-release workflows).
- [ ] Re-run the SeqCst inventory at ff56d60; select one coherent family;
      apply justified weakest-ordering relaxations naming each happens-before
      edge; verify focused nextest + clippy -D warnings + loom where present;
      push branch and record PR evidence. No Atlas pointer move.
